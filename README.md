## My process

I'm definetly still learning.  I broke down the sections and sub sections.  Assigned sections flex-directions as needed.
once everything was in the proper place I started styling and fixed as needed until I had a funtional and styled mobile version.  I then started with the desktop version.  I had a few issues with sizing and the background images.  I ran into some nesting issues while styling.  I had fun with this project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS

### What I learned

I learned more about image placement.  I learned a little about nesting conflicts.  I learned its not smart to use em on font size although I didnt have an issue I changed em to rem.
It was neat to work with sizing elements so you could use flex styling to get different results.
I learned more about svg's and how to use them.  They seem versatile I just need to learn more.

```html
<div class="star">
            <svg width="17" height="16">
              <use href="#star-icon" />
            </svg>
          </div>
          <div class="star">
            <svg width="17" height="16">
              <use href="#star-icon" />
            </svg>
          </div>
```

```css
   .banner-1 {
        align-self: flex-start;
    }

    .banner-3 {
        align-self: flex-end;
    }
```

### Continued development

I am very excited.  I look forward to creating more pojects researching best practices and refining my skills.
